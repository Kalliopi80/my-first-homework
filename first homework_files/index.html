    <h1><strong>A haunted man</strong></h1>
      <img src="./hellraiser_1508961627_crop_550x354.jpg">
    <p>Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, and visual artist. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, <strong>the Books of Blood</strong>, which established him as a <strong>leading horror writer</strong>. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the <em>Hellraiser</em> and <em>Candyman</em> series. He was also the executive producer of the film <em>Gods and Monsters.</em>

Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States as well as within his own books. He has created original characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been adapted to comics.</p>

        
    <h1><strong>Early years</strong></h1>
  
  <img src="./clive+barker.jpg">
      
    <p>Barker was born in Liverpool, Merseyside, the son of Joan Ruby, a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm. He was educated at <em>Dovedale Primary School, Quarry Bank High School</em> and the <em>University of Liverpool</em>, where he studied <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Philosophy</strong>.

When he was three years old, Barker witnessed the French skydiver <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Valentin">Léo Valentin </a> plummet to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.</p>
    
    <h1><strong>Master of Horror</strong></h1>
      <img src="./0iw5wuvaitty.jpg" width="350">
    
    <p>Barker is an author of <em>contemporary horror/fantasy</em>. He began writing horror early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in <strong>Books of Blood 1 – 6</strong>) and the Faustian novel <strong>The Damnation Game</strong> (1985). Later he moved towards modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in <strong>Weaveworld</strong> (1987), <strong>The Great and Secret Show </strong>(1989), the world-spanning <strong>Imajica</strong> (1991), and <strong>Sacrament </strong>(1996).

When the <strong>Books of Blood</strong> were first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was quoted on the book covers: <em>"I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker."</em> As influences on his writing, Barker lists Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Ray Bradbury, William S. Burroughs, William Blake and Jean Cocteau, among others.

He is the writer of the best-selling <strong>Abarat</strong> series, and plans on producing two more novels in the series.</p>
        
  <h1><strong>Film Work</strong></h1>
      <img src="./Clive-Barker-Triple-Feature-14.jpg" width="400">
          
        <p>Barker has an interest in film production. He wrote the screenplays for <strong>Underworld</strong> and <strong>Rawhead Rex</strong> (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with <strong>Hellraiser</strong> (1987), based on his novella <em>The Hellbound Heart</em>. After his film <strong>Nightbreed </strong>(1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct <strong>Lord of Illusions</strong> (1995). The short story <em>"The Forbidden"</em>, from Barker's <strong>Books of Blood</strong>, provided the basis for the 1992 film <strong>Candyman</strong> and its two sequels. Barker was an executive producer of the film<strong> Gods and Monsters</strong> (1998), which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his <strong>The Abarat Quintet</strong> books under Disney's management, but because of<em> creative differences</em>, the project was cancelled.

In 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company <em>Midnight Picture Show</em> with the intent of producing two horror films per year.

In October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original<strong> Hellraiser</strong> film. He is developing a film based on his Tortured Souls line of toys from McFarlane Toys.</p>
  
  <h1><strong>Visual arts and Comics</strong></h1>
      <img src="./bob1ukh1.jpg" width="300">
  
  <p>Barker is also a prolific visual artist, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, <em>Dread</em>, published by Fantaco in the early '90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, <strong>Incarnations</strong> (1995) and <strong>Forms of Heaven</strong> (1996); and on the second printing of the original British publications of his Books of Blood series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel <strong>The Thief of Always</strong> and for the<strong> Abarat</strong> series. His artwork has been exhibited at <em>Bert Green Fine Art</em> in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the <em>Bess Cutler Gallery</em> in New York and <em>La Luz De Jesus</em> in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection Clive Barker,<strong> Illustrator</strong>, published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in <strong>Visions of Heaven and Hell</strong>, published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books.

He worked on the horror video game Clive Barker's Undying, providing the voice for the character Ambrose, which was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and released in 2001. He worked on <strong>Jericho</strong> for Codemasters, which was released in late 2007 and also created Halloween costume designs for <em>Disguise Costumes</em>.
